1. INTRODUCTION

Neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, enabling breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. At their core, these networks consist of interconnected nodes that process and transform data through weighted connections.

The power of neural networks lies in their ability to learn complex patterns from data. Through backpropagation, networks adjust their internal weights to minimize prediction errors.

2. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

• Input Layer: Receives raw data (images, text, numbers)
• Hidden Layers: Extract and transform features
• Output Layer: Produces final predictions

Each neuron applies:
  1. Weighted sum of inputs
  2. Bias addition
  3. Activation function (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)

3. ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS

ReLU: f(x) = max(0, x)
  → Most popular, fast computation
  → Avoids vanishing gradient problem

Sigmoid: f(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)
  → Outputs between 0-1
  → Used in binary classification

Tanh: f(x) = tanh(x)
  → Outputs between -1 and 1
  → Zero-centered output

4. TRAINING PROCESS

Step 1: Forward propagation of inputs
Step 2: Calculate loss (error)
Step 3: Backpropagate errors
Step 4: Update weights via gradient descent
Step 5: Repeat until convergence
